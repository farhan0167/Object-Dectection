# Object-Dectection with Transformers

Object Detection is a fundamental task in the domain of computer vision. Re-
cent advances in the vision transformer has led to many breakthroughs in tasks
such as image segmentation and classification. In our project, we want to extend
upon a dectection transformer, known as DETR, and address the issues it faces.
Our proposed methodology is to move away from the model’s reliance on convo-
lutional nuerual networks altogether and introduce a self supervised pre-training
methodology.
